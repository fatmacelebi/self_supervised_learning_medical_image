# self_supervised_learning_medical_image

We are sharing the codes that we used for self-supervised learning, and the codes that we used self-supervised pretrained models during transfer learning with Mask R-CNN on medical images. Self supervised pretraining is applied on unlabaled medical images and transfer learning is applied on labeled medical images.
